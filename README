ib_srp-fixes from ProfitBricks README
=====================================

Introduction
------------

ProfitBricks has an own idea of how the InfiniBand SRP initiator should
handle connection issues, timeouts and HA/multipathing. In the IaaS 2.0
cloud with many VM hosting servers and lots of SRP connections as well as
LUNs this has to work rock solid without manual efforts or the srp-tools.
Connections are established directly through sysfs without discovery as
the target IB HCA port GUIDs can't change.

SCSI disks may never be lost in another case than explicit remote port
deletion. Fast IO failing is required in a calculable settable time frame
and a continuous SRP reconnect is required. The reconnect has to be
implemented in kernel code and may not operate like a DDoS attack like
open-iscsi does. So the initiator may only reconnect the targets one by one.

Installation
------------

This repository is not meant to be fully functional for use with any older
kernel version. It is used to show ProfitBricks custom ib_srp patches in
the hope that these are useful for others as well and that (parts of) these
are accepted for the mainline. The patches are applied to the latest kernel
version from which the files to be changed by patches have been copied.

Install the patched files by copying them into the underlaying mainline
kernel git repository and compile them in-tree.
