-----------------------------------------------------
* changed the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Fail IO faster based on block and QP timeout"
  so that the SCSI host isn't set to 'cancel' anymore
  as we can't set it back to 'running' otherwise

* added temporary commit:
  "IB/srp: Show that a reconnect can work"
  to provide a manual reconnect for testing

* updated the 02fail_io_fast test for the correct
  expected SCSI host state ('running', not 'cancel')

0.2, 2013-04-16
-----------------------------------------------------
* removed the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Reconnect timed out paths when connecting"
  as it turned out that this was the wrong fix for a
  back porting issue 3.9-rc6 isn't affected with

* updated the 02fail_io_fast test for correct 3.9-rc6
  mainline behavior
