0.6.1, 2013-07-15
-----------------------------------------------------
* InfiniBand congestion bugfix release: During congestion
  the SCSI error handlers run very likely simultaneously
  while QP times out and IO is failed. We may not set the
  QP into error state with pending IO, we've noticed.
  There were also offline devices not set to running again
  after successful reconnect. Another issue was that
  commands were still queued while the transport already
  failed.

  Commits:
  IB/srp: Don't set the QP into error state in tl_err_work
  IB/srp: Set sdevs to running upon successful reconnect
  IB/srp: Fix deadlock if srp_handle_qp_err() is called
  IB/srp: Block SCSI requests if transport fails

0.6, 2013-05-08
-----------------------------------------------------
* removed the manual reconnect as it was temporary

* added automatic reconnect consisting of the commits:
  "IB/srp: Introduce automatic reconnect",
  "IB/srp: Make the default reconnect delay configurable",
  "IB/srp: Show the number of failed targets in sysfs",
  "IB/srp: Make the reconnect delay configurable in sysfs"

* added the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Show the manual disconnect in the kernel log"

0.5, 2013-04-25
-----------------------------------------------------
Major changes to fail IO fast based on QP timeout only

* renamed the sysfs file "fast_io_fail_tmo" into
  "blk_rq_tmo" by replacing the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Allow fast IO failing through rport sysfs"
  with
  "IB/srp: Configure blk_rq_tmo through rport sysfs"

* set a minimal settable blk request queue timeout of 10s

* replaced fast IO failing with the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Fail IO faster based on QP timeout"

* added the following commits:
  "IB/srp: Fix a possible race in srp_reset_host()"
  "IB/srp: Make the QP timeout configurable through sysfs"
  "IB/srp: Show QP retry count in srp_host sysfs"

* made the reconnect operate during SRP_TARGET_FAILED
  state to prevent possible state issues or races

* added a test for double login

* adapted all tests for the new behavior

0.4, 2013-04-18
-----------------------------------------------------
* removed the superfluous scan mutex locking in the
  following commit:
  "IB/srp: Allow fast IO failing through rport sysfs"

* changed the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Fail IO faster based on block and QP timeout"
  so that the scsi_target_[un]block() functions are
  used like in srp_reconnect_target().

* added the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Don't remove SCSI hosts upon failed reconnect"

* updated the 02fail_io_fast test for the new behavior
  NOT loosing the SCSI host upon failed reconnect

0.3, 2013-04-17
-----------------------------------------------------
* changed the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Fail IO faster based on block and QP timeout"
  so that the SCSI host isn't set to 'cancel' anymore
  as we can't set it back to 'running' otherwise

* added temporary commit:
  "IB/srp: Show that a reconnect can work"
  to provide a manual reconnect for testing

* updated the 02fail_io_fast test for the correct
  expected SCSI host state ('running', not 'cancel')

0.2, 2013-04-16
-----------------------------------------------------
* removed the following commit:
  "IB/srp: Reconnect timed out paths when connecting"
  as it turned out that this was the wrong fix for a
  back porting issue 3.9-rc6 isn't affected with

* updated the 02fail_io_fast test for correct 3.9-rc6
  mainline behavior

0.1, 2013-04-12
