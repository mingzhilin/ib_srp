Description
-----------

The goal of this test is to check if the block layer timeout is
set correctly for SRP LUNs which are hot added.

The background for this test is that the sysfs attribute
'fast_io_fail_tmo' only sets the timeout for the currently
connected SCSI disks. The hot added LUNs are handled by the
srp_slave_configure() function.

Required Hardware
-----------------

You should have a target system and an initiator system connected
with two IB/RDMA paths. The smallest possible test setup is
composed of two desktop machines with two IB/RDMA ports each
connected back2back.

Preparation
-----------

Check for all shell scripts in 'common' and this directory if
the configuration is set correctly for your setup. You should
run SCST on the target and the ib_srp driver from this repo
on the initiator.

Make sure you've got some equal sized files prepared - all
with the same prefix and a number at the end starting at '1'
(e.g. "vol1", "vol2", ...).

============================================================

Step 1: Preparation
-------------------

Target:
$ ./start_scst.sh

Initiator:
$ ./connect_srp.sh
$ ./set_timeout.sh 15

Expected result:
Target and initiator are connected via SRP, the exported
LUNs are available at both paths on the initiator. All
SRP SCSI disks have the same default block layer timeout.
This should be '15'.

Step 2: Add a LUN
-----------------

In this step we assume that you've got three SRP devices
already exported and want to add LUN 4.

Target:
$ ./add_lun.sh 4

Initiator:
$ ./scan_lun.sh 4

Expected result:
One more SCSI disk should be visiable per path. So this
should be two additional disks in total with LUN 4.

The block layer timeout of these disks should be at '15'
as well, now.

Step 3: Remove LUN, reset block layer timeout, scan LUN
-------------------------------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./rm_lun.sh 4
$ ./set_timeout.sh off
$ ./scan_lun.sh 4

Expected result:
The block layer timeout should be at the default '61'
for all four LUNs at both paths.

Step 4: Roll back for the next test
-----------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./disconnect_srp.sh

Target:
$ ./del_lun.sh 4
$ ./stop_scst.sh

Expected result:
No SRP initiator or target modules are loaded.
