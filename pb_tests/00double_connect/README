Description
-----------

The goal of this test is to check if a double connect is rejected
correctly. If a double connect is possible, then this can cause
the multipath-tools to hang and having twice the number of SRP
disks.

Required Hardware
-----------------

You should have a target system and an initiator system connected
with two IB/RDMA paths. The smallest possible test setup is
composed of two desktop machines with two IB/RDMA ports each
connected back2back.

Preparation
-----------

Check for all shell scripts in 'common' and this directory if
the configuration is set correctly for your setup. You should
run SCST on the target and the ib_srp driver from this repo
on the initiator.

Make sure you've got some equal sized files prepared - all
with the same prefix and a number at the end starting at '1'
(e.g. "vol1", "vol2", ...).

On the initiator the multipath tools shouldn't be running.

============================================================

Step 1: Connect SRP
-------------------

Target:
$ ./start_scst.sh

Initiator:
$ ./connect_srp.sh 7

Expected result:
Target and initiator are connected via SRP, the exported
LUNs are available at both paths on the initiator. The
number of QP retries is at 7. All SRP SCSI disks have the
same default block layer timeout. This should be at '61'.

Step 2: Try double connect
--------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./connect_srp.sh 7
$ dmesg | tail

Expected result:
You can see an error "File exists" on each path you
tried to double connect.
The kernel log shows the following message:
"Refusing to add already connected SRP target port"

Step 3: Roll back for the next test
-----------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./disconnect_srp.sh

Target:
$ ./stop_scst.sh

Expected result:
No SRP initiator or target modules are loaded.
