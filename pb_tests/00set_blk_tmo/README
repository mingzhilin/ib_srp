Description
-----------

The goal of this test is to check if the block layer timeout can
be set for all SRP connected SCSI disks at once through the SRP
remote port sysfs attribute 'fast_io_fail_tmo'.

Required Hardware
-----------------

You should have a target system and an initiator system connected
with two IB/RDMA paths. The smallest possible test setup is
composed of two desktop machines with two IB/RDMA ports each
connected back2back.

Preparation
-----------

Check for all shell scripts in 'common' and this directory if
the configuration is set correctly for your setup. You should
run SCST on the target and the ib_srp driver from this repo
on the initiator.

Make sure you've got some equal sized files prepared - all
with the same prefix and a number at the end starting at '1'
(e.g. "vol1", "vol2", ...).

============================================================

Step 1: Connect SRP
-------------------

Target:
$ ./start_scst.sh

Initiator:
$ ./connect_srp.sh

Expected result:
Target and initiator are connected via SRP, the exported
LUNs are available at both paths on the initiator. All
SRP SCSI disks have the same default block layer timeout.
This should be '61' (fast IO failing disabled) by default.

Step 2: Set block layer timeout
-------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./set_timeout.sh 15

Expected result:
Like step 1 but all SRP SCSI disks should have the value
'15' as block layer timeout, now.

Step 3: Reset block layer timeout
---------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./set_timeout.sh off

Expected result:
Like step 1.

Step 4: Roll back for the next test
-----------------------------------

Initiator:
$ ./disconnect_srp.sh

Target:
$ ./stop_scst.sh

Expected result:
No SRP initiator or target modules are loaded.
